How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

The staging area can be considered as a cache or buffer to be submitted to the remote repository. It is only temporary to let users decide which 
changes need to be commited. Deleting or adding items into staging area won't affect working directory and repository. Only committing could affect
repository and only operating on files directly in working directory will affect it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

One can use the command git diff --staged to see changes between staging area and repository. Or one can use command git diff to see differences
between working directory and staging area and make sure that the added changes into staging area actually count for one logical change. Then one
can safely commit.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

Using command git log --graph --oneline branch_name_1 [branch_name_n] can help me trace back along the commit histories. Drawing a diagram help me
see the entire history of commits from different branches.

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in

What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges
manually?
