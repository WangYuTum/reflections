When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

When I'm on a business trip or using a temporary computer to access and edit files of a repository, while I don't want to 
create a local repository on the computer.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because there might be a possibility that I'm working on a new feature on my local repository and I haven't finish it yet.
I want to update from remote until I finish my new feature so that the up-to-date changes wouldn't affect or mess up with
my new feature that I'm still working on with.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

-Forks: only work on GitHub repositories, which clones one repository and create another new repository on GitHub.
One can use Fork to copy/clone someone else's projects/codes on GitHub.
-Clones: work on both GitHub repository and local repository and between them. Fork is a built-in clone on GitHub,
one can also clone a repository on GitHub to his local computer. In addition, one can also clone a repository on 
a local computer to his local computer.
One can use command git clone to copy a remote repository on GitHub to his local computer.
-Branches: work on a single repository, to create a different version of codes or to test new features on a different 
version of codes.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
